# Melvor Typing Project
## About
This project provides official type definitions for Melvor Idle, for use in developing mods.

The types are divided into two folders:
- gameTypes: This contains typedefs that were generated using the game's source files
- libraryTypes: This contains typedefs that are used to expose libararies that the game has to global scope

## Library Dependencies
This project also contains a package.json which can be used to install the typedefs and libraries that Melvor currently uses with node.js. These are available in global scope and may be utilized by mods.
